# Repository Overview #

This repository contains the jupyter notebooks that I developed to learn about aeroelastic system identification.

## Usage

To run the notebooks, I recommend using the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) of Python. You need to use an environment with the following packages installed:

- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`
- `ipympl`
- `ipywidgets`
- `ipython`
- `ipykernel`
